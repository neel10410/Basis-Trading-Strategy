Basis Trading Strategy
======================

Overview
------------

Welcome to the Basis Trading Strategy protocol! This project utilizes the Foundry framework to implement a unique trading strategy designed to generate profit from funding rates in the cryptocurrency market. The protocol allows users to deposit tokens and participate in the earnings generated through basis trading.

How It Works
------------

1.  **Token Deposit**: Users can deposit their tokens into the protocol's pool. In return, they receive LP tokens representing their share in the pool.
    
2.  **Basis Trading Strategy**:
    
    *   The protocol employs a basis trading strategy by going short in ETH futures and simultaneously buying ETH on the spot market.
        
    *   If the market price of ETH goes up, the loss from the futures short position is offset by the gain from the spot position. Conversely, if the market price goes down, the gain from the futures short position offsets the loss from the spot position.
        
    *   The key profit driver is the funding rate, which is the interest paid by long position holders to short position holders in the futures market.
        
3.  **Earnings Distribution**: The earnings generated from the basis trading strategy (primarily from the funding rate) are distributed to the users who deposited tokens in the pool. The distribution is proportional to the number of LP tokens held by each user.
    
    
Example Scenario
----------------

1.  **Market Scenario**: The market price of ETH increases.
    
2.  **Protocol Action**: The protocol's short position in ETH futures incurs a loss, but the spot position in ETH gains an equivalent amount, offsetting the loss.
    
3.  **Profit**: The protocol earns the funding rate from the futures market.
    
4.  **Distribution**: The earned funding rate is distributed to users based on their LP token holdings.
    

Conclusion
----------

The Basis Trading Strategy protocol offers a unique way for users to earn from the funding rates in the cryptocurrency futures market by leveraging a carefully designed trading strategy. By depositing tokens into the protocol, users can participate in the earnings generated and benefit from the protocol's performance.
